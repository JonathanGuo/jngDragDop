# jngDragDop
A simple AngularJS module for drag and drop. jngDragDrop directive allows you to enable native HTML5 drag & drop feature on your elements.

Documentation is currently in progress.

##Why do I create this directive?
After trying several options from github, I couldn't really use them in my project. Some of them have difficulties to use with morden AngularJS framework and not supported anymore. Some are too specific for the limit usage. I need a directive that allows me to drag an element and drop it into a block level element. This directive just does this simple job.

##WARNING
This directive just borded on 25 May, 2015. It probably is not stable enough. Test it, see if it works as you wished.

##Supported browsers
All the browsers that support native HTML5 drag & drop API.
###Known browser bug
At the time this module was developed, Firefox has an issue of dragging button element. Please use div or another element to replace the button for browser compability. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=646823

##Rest documentation is currently in progress
